# ScriptedStyles

This is a post-personal-art-business now hobby; I make digital art in Python using primarily mathematical algorithmic techniques, but also draw from various image processing and scientific analysis methods which I have learned about directly or adjacently from my undergraduate education. 

What is present reflects most of my work, with larger image and data files not being present. 

Sample_Images contains some of my personal favorites, "images" has been used to publicly upload images for automated IG/FB/Etsy posts, all at once. 

For more insights on my automation stack, the scripts in Main_driver (code_and_unpublished_samples -> Automation -> Main_driver) illustrate the workflow. 

While some of what's here are still ideas, most files will run if a few things are changed (path, remove unique_filename call (which I used to ensure images did not get overridden), necessary files are added from (sub)folders).
