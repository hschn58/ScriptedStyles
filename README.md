# ScriptedStyles

This is a post-personal-art-business now hobby; I make digital art in Python using primarily mathematical algorithmic techniques, but also draw from various image processing and scientific analysis methods which I have learned about directly or adjacently from my undergraduate education. 

What is present reflects most of my work, with larger image and data files not being present. 

Sample_Images contains some of my personal favorites, "images" has been used to publicly upload images for automated IG/FB/Etsy posts, all at once. 

For more insights on my automation stack, the scripts in Main_driver (code_and_unpublished_samples -> Automation -> Main_driver) illustrate the workflow. 

While some of what's here are still ideas, most files will run if a few things are changed (path, remove unique_filename call (which I used to ensure images did not get overridden), necessary files are added from (sub)folders). 

# Usage

The fastest way to run these scripts is to clone the repo and try to run them, after Python and the external dependencies Matplotlib, Numpy, and Scipy have been installed. This is a compilation of whatever came to mind that I felt was worth pursuing, so the structure for each project idea (which corresponds to a folder in "June 2024" or Next_Release (Codebase -> Designs -> Releases)) is different. Most of the projects did not require heavy lifting from other external libraries.

Examples (there are plenty others): 

Once Matplotlib, Numpy, and Scipy have been installed, 'flowers_v4.py' is an interesting example to run (Codebase -> Designs -> Releases -> Next_release -> Heatmap). It can use several content subjects (rose, daisy, spiral, lily, dahlia, superformula, or external (external has data for a heart and a form of Koch snowflake)). Detailed information can by found at the top of the script. 

For simpler runs, Codebase -> Designs -> Releases -> June_2024 -> triangles -> Code -> Mult -> cool_separate_lines_highcolorchange_cyclicmap.py can be run after right after "funcs_triang_separate.py" in the same folder is moved to the same local directory. 

Codebase -> Designs -> Releases -> Next_release -> Heat_diffusion_soln -> q2_animation2.py can be run immediately after downloading.
