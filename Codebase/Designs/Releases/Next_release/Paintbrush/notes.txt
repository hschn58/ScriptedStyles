The goal of this project was to abstract the idea of paintbrush brush strokes to their core properties: something that takes up a finite space, leaves a characteristic pattern that is influenced by how it is used, and that can take different colors

In future, can use AI to think of the desired hollow region found by canny as a fish: imagine where the scales would go, how big they would be in each spot: make a matrix for this, then apply the brush for each of those points
